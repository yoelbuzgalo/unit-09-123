Unit 08 Practice Problems (Unit 9 Day 1 mini practicum)

The goal of these "mini practica" is to give you practice with coding problems
similar to those that you will see on the midterm practica. You will be 
required to solve each problem with minimal assistance. You should use these
mini-practica as an opportunity to gauge your preparedness for the exams.

You should create all of your required files in this folder along with these
instructions.

Each mini-practicum counts as a homework assignment. 
===============================================================================

1. Open the "practice" module and define a function named 
   "decreasing_comparator" that declares parameters for integer values a and b.
   It should return True if b <= a, False otherwise. You have been provided the 
   increasing_comparator(a,b) function, which returns True if b >= a, False 
   otherwise.

2. Define a function named "is_sorted" that declares parameters for a_list, and
   comparator=increasing_comparator (default value). The function should return
   True if the list is sorted depending on the comparator being used, and False 
   otherwise. 

   Test is_sorted from main using both increasing and decreasing comparators.
   Using list1 = [20, 10, 30] and list2 = [30, 20, 10] as an example, expected
   output of the function is as follows:

   >>> is_sorted(list1) 
   False
   >>> is_sorted(list1, decreasing_comparator)
   False
   >>> is_sorted(list2, increasing_comparator)
   False
   >>> is_sorted(list2, decreasing_comparator)
   True
